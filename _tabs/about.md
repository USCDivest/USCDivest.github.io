# Mission statement (link to full doc)
We, the USC Divest from Death coalition, establish our occupation most fundamentally in solidarity with the people of Palestine as they resist genocide and continue in their struggle for liberation. Furthermore, the struggle for Palestinian liberation is not an isolated movement; it is emblematic of the broader fight against colonialism, occupation, and injustice worldwide. In solidarity with the Palestinian people, collective liberation demands that we recognize their struggle as our own. Just as Palestinians resist occupation and seek self-determination, marginalized communities everywhere strive for autonomy, equality, and justice. By amplifying the voices of Palestinians and supporting their struggle, we contribute to the broader movement for collective liberation, affirming our commitment to freedom for all oppressed peoples.

# USC is complicit

# Demands (button/link to page)
## 1. End War Profiteering and Investment in Genocide.
• It is unclear how much of USC's $13.8 billion assets are invested in Israeli companies and industries. Per our demands, "USC must fully disclose and divest its finances and endowment from companies and institutions that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide, and occupation in Palestine, including the US Military and weapons manufacturing. Accountability must be ensured through full transparency around financial investments."

## 2. Complete Academic Boycott of Israel.
• USC has study abroad programs at Hebrew University's Rothenberg International School and Reichman University. As the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel states: "To enroll, or participate in any way, in a study abroad program at an Israeli institution means ignoring if not perpetuating the ongoing violation of the academic, and, indeed, human freedoms of Palestinians."

## 3. Protect free speech on campus and provide full amnesty to all students, staff, and faculty disciplined, penalized, or fired for their pro-Palestine activism.
• The 2024 Valedictorian - Asna Tabassum - has been silenced for her support of Palestinians. But this isn't the first time free speech debates have flared at USC. In 2020, high ranking USC student government member Isabel Washington expressed racist and anti-Palestinian sentiments. Additionally, in the same year, two more members - USG President Truman Fritz and USG VP Rose Ritch - resigned over allegations of racism. In the wake of these events, Palestinian students have not felt safe. As former SJP President Ramy Hassan stated in 2020: “Ultimately, the University has alienated its Palestinian students. It has showed us on far too many occasions that our existence on campus is not one that is welcomed, let alone supported.”
## 4. Stop the Displacement, from South Central to Palestine.
• Real estate is undoubtedly political. At USC, a student housing boom - fueled by private developers - is changing the face of historically Black and Brown neighborhoods around USC, displacing tenants and gentrifying communities. In Gaza, where domicide - defined as the widespread or systematic destruction of homes - reigns, real estate speculation in the wake of the war has already begun (Additionally: see comments by Jared Kushner, this 'joke' by one Israeli company, or real estate company 'My Home In Israel' which has begun selling parcels of land in the Occupied West Bank).

## 5. No Policing on Campus.
• USC, since 2002, has spent more than $550 million dollars on the Department of Public Safety. They have hired former racist law enforcement officers and Erroll Southers - the Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance - has formerly worked with the ICT, an anti-Palestinian organization. There is also a history of Black and Brown students being racially profiled by DPS, with one student stating "They watch us closely, more closely than they watch any other students on campus." Another example is Judah Adkin's wrongful arrest by the LAPD, and USC's failure to support him in 2022

## 6. End the Silence on the Genocide in Palestine.
• Recently, a human rights expert testified before the United Nations, stating there are 'reasonable grounds' that a genocide is occuring in Gaza. This is nothing new. Since November, UN experts have pointed to the risk of genocide in Gaza. Now it's happening before our eyes. But top media organizations - such as the New York Times - have actively avoided using terms such as 'genocide,' 'ethnic cleansing,' and 'occupied territory' in their coverage.

# FAQ
* Q: Is USC Divest from Death antisemitic?
* A: USC Divest from Death Coalition focuses on divesting USC from current economic investments surrounding Israel, so is not an antisemitic organization and firmly denounces antisemitic behavior. Antisemitism is defined as a "hostility to, or, prejudice against Jewish people," and to equate our movement against Israeli apartheid with antisemitism is to overlook both our anti-zionist Jewish comrades and silence the voices of Palestinian people who are resisting an genocidal occupation. Israel and its supporters weaponize Judaism against Palestinians and all those in solidarity with Palestinian liberation in order to silence to silence those who resist its colonial and apartheid regime. Our anti-zionist Jewish comrades are vital to our coalition and are continuing the tradition of Judaism as a religion that condemns all forms of oppresion and violence and seeks instead for a more just and liberated world for all people, most urgently the Palestinian people. We believe that the liberation of Palestine is intrinsically tied to Jewish liberation and the liberation of all people.
