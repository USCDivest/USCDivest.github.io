# USC BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THEIR INVOLVEMENTS IN WAR PROFITEERING AND ISRAELI BUSINESS VENTURES

The following information includes each trustee on USC’s board and their involvement in other companies. 

A majority of these other companies either directly profit off of war efforts and Israeli business ventures, or have majority stakeholders from companies that also invest heavily in weapons manufacturing.

Some of the largest U.S. asset management/ investment firms (which are typically majority stakeholders) are  BlackRock, Inc., The VanGuard Group, and State Street Corporation. These firms invest billions of dollars in weapons manufacturing companies, aiding in their creation of military-grade arms to kill innocent civilians globally. Similarly, as they are majority stakeholders in many companies, these companies then have to abide by certain practices in order to appease these bloodthirsty firms.

We demand that these trustees push to divest the other companies they influence from bloodthirsty investors that can force their hands to aid in American and European terrorism.
